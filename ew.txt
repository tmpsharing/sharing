# Spring Boot SEP Interaction Demo

This project is a simple Spring Boot application demonstrating interaction with SEP through request sending and response receiving in asynchronous mode. It includes examples of Rest and MQ clients, as well as a simple booking service that generates sample requests, sends them to SEP, and processes the responses. The unit tests cover three different scenarios.
